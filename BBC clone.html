                    <p id="bold" >"My armor, it was never a distraction or a hobby, it was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. But one thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man."
                        <br> ―Tony Stark</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When Thanos had the Infinity Gauntlet, Doctor Strange points his finger, looking at Tony Stark, indicating that this is the win out of the 14,00,605 outcomes.

                            For few seconds, you can see the fear in Tony’s face and eyes, but like a true hero, he goes up to Thanos and tries to grab the Infinity Gauntlet. However, Thanos pushes him away and snapped his finger. Nothing happens. We get to see that Tony has the stones on his suit. His last words were, “And I… am… Iron Man”. He snaps finger.
                            
                            The Chitauri army turns into dust, killing them. Thanos himself gets killed by the snap. Tony Stark dies in front of Rhodes, Pepper, and Spider-Man, with Pepper giving her final words to Tony Stark: You can rest now.
                            
                            So the way Tony Stark died was due to the gamma radiation, burning the complete left side of his face.</p>
                 <p>April 26 2019 It's an unforgettable day in the World's History. </p>
